# Chat API

Chat API made with Nest.js

Use `yarn install` to install the dependencies and `yarn start:dev` to start the project locally.
For it to work locally you will need a postgres database running on localhost:5432. You can either provide one yourself or start one with docker.
A sample is already configured in the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml)

It is currently hosted on [https://chat.johannes-jahn.com/](https://chat.johannes-jahn.com/).
You can find the generated API doc under [https://chat.johannes-jahn.com/api](https://chat.johannes-jahn.com/api)
